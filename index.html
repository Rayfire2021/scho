Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate perfomance and payroll data.

    2.Economics
    Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time recording, buddy punching, absenteseeim, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment.As a matter of fact, a study done by the Assium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management system.
    <br>
    3.Productivity / Efficiency
    Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair.It takes time to process paper sheet and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
